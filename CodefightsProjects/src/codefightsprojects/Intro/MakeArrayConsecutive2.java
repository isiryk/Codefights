/**
 * Task: Ratiorg got statues of different sizes as a present from CodeMaster 
 * for his birthday, each statue having an non-negative integer size. Since he 
 * likes to make things perfect, he wants to arrange them from smallest to 
 * largest so that each statue will be bigger than the previous one exactly by 1. 
 * He may need some additional statues to be able to accomplish that. Help him 
 * figure out the minimum number of additional statues needed.
 * 
 * Example:
 * For statues = [6, 2, 3, 8], the output should be
 * makeArrayConsecutive2(statues) = 3.
 * Ratiorg needs statues of sizes 4, 5 and 7.
