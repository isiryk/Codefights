 * Task: Below we will define an n-interesting polygon. Your task is to find 
 * the area of a polygon for a given n.

 * A 1-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length 1. An 
 * n-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the n - 1-interesting polygon 
 * and appending 1-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side. You can see 
 * the 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-interesting polygons in the picture below.
