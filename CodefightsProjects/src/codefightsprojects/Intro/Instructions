Folders are ranked by difficulty according to 
CodeFights:

Rank "a" is the easiest
Rank "l" is the hardest

Every single class is there simply for logic.
May need to import some classes to make it work.
Need to also add main methods to run.

Overall codefights.com provided these challenges
and I provided the correct solutions by their testcases

Use at your own risk.
